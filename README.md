# Reframe360 Adobe version

This is the code for an Adobe CC plugin that I developed mostly in summer 2018. I was initially planning to monetize the plugin, but as I am fully focused on my university studies at the moment, I am pretty sure that I won't find time to work on it anymore. I hope that the code can be helpful to someone.
The website for the project, inluding example videos, can be found [here](http://reframe360.com).

## Dependencies

The project is primarily based on the Adobe Premiere SDK, but also uses parts of the After Effects SDK.
The Visual Studio project contains absolute paths for headers etc., please infer your own project structure and necessary headers from those.

I will add more information here when I have time.
